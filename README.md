# Task-scheduling-Using-ERR(Enhanced Round Robin)
  This considers time slices in a dynamic manner for each task that enters the queue.The time slices are assigned based on the Mean bursting time of all the waiting task in the queue. Two memory registers are used to store the total burst time and average burst time.In the starting of allocation process it allocates certain task to VM  allows it to completely finish the task.Later it calculates the time slice for the incoming task .Once the time quantum is lapses it either moves the task back to the queue or else if the task is completely finished executing then it will remove that particular task from the queue.The scheduler will change the register values by subtracting the time quantum from one register and adding it to another.
